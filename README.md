# Overview

A trading simulator between a Broker and a Stock Exchange using the [Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol](https://www.fixtrading.org/). It's a study project using [QuickFIX/J](https://www.quickfixj.org/), [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), Docker, Docker Compose and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

If you want to participate on this project, just open an issue and we can talk about!

Both Broker and Exchange systems were built with Quarkus on the back-end and Angular on the front-end. 

The back-ends communicate each other with QuickFIX/J and each has a schema into the PostgreSQL.

Each Angular front-end communicates with the Quarkus back-end using REST and Websockets.

# System Architecture

The architecture consists of:
- **Exchange Back-End**: Quarkus REST API with QuickFIX Acceptor
- **Exchange Front-End**: Angular UI for exchange management
- **Broker Back-End**: Quarkus REST API with QuickFIX Initiator
- **Broker Front-End**: Angular UI for broker trading platform
- **PostgreSQL**: Shared database for logging and persistence

```
$ chmod +x ./run-from-docker-hub.sh
$ ./run-from-docker-hub.sh
```

Docker Hub images:
- [exchange-back-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/exchange-back-end)
- [exchange-front-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/exchange-front-end)
- [broker-back-end](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/felipewind/broker-back-end)
